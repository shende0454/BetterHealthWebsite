		<h1>Better Health Resource Page</h1>
	<p> I want to create a website that makes it easy to view information regarding how to stay healthy physically and mentally.
	This website will help make the world a better place by providing a resource page that has information on what to do to stay healthy. 
	Health is very important in society, and this website will lead and guide users to a healthier lifestyle. The goal and purpose of this website is to make the world a healthier place.
	The type of information on this page will be workouts, meal plans, drinks, and healthy daily activities. 
	The intended audience for this website are people that are serious about there health, and want to change there health for the better.
	Some people need a broad resource that has information on not only workouts and meals but activities, drinks, and healthy ways of living.
    In addition, the target audience that this website will best benefit are unhealthy people that need guidance on some ways to stay healthy.	
	Some important website characteristics to this audience are photos, health information, different health catagories, and a step by step guides to a healthier lifestyle.
	</p>
	<p><br> 
	I will make the website relevant to the audience by having information that is directly related and beneficial to the audience.
	This resource will target unhealthy people by giving them answers to how to stay healthy.
	This information will be factual and easy to access. In addition, the information will be easy to navigate and understand.
	In addition this website will target the audience by providing useful techniques and habits to improve the audiences lifestyles.
	The timeline for the stages of the website is every 3-4 business days.
	This is because of the time it will take to gather information and structure it in the best way possible for my audience.
	But in the best case the website stages may be delivered every 2-3 business days.
	It is important to ensure that the information and the characteristics of each stage is efficient. And as beneficial for my audience as possible.
	</p>
	<p><br>
	To gather information for this page, I will research data on the web.
	The data and information will come from reliable and trusted health references.
	The type of references this may include is webmd, health.harvard.edu, and familydoctor.org.
	These types of references are very trusted and will provide factual information for my targeted audience.
	Trusted references will allow for my website to be as accurate and helpful as possible.
	This will allow me to have accurate information from reliable resources.
	For graphic/media sources, I will acquire these from the web and I will be sure to cite these sources.
	This site should be updated every month to ensure the information is updated.
	In addition, montly updates will add more information for newly discovered ways to stay healthy.
	Therefore the users will have the most valuable information as possible.
	I will be in charge of updating this website.
